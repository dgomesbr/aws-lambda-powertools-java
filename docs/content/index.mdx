Powertools is a suite of utilities for AWS Lambda Functions that makes tracing with AWS X-Ray, structured logging and creating custom metrics asynchronously easier.

## Install

Powertools dependencies are available in Maven Central. You can use your favourite dependency management tool to install it

* [maven](https://maven.apache.org/):
```xml
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>software.amazon.lambda</groupId>
        <artifactId>powertools-tracing</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.0-beta</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>software.amazon.lambda</groupId>
        <artifactId>powertools-logging</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.0-beta</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```

And configure the aspectj-maven-plugin to compile-time weave (CTW) the aws-lambda-powertools-java aspects into your project:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        ...
        <plugin>
             <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
             <artifactId>aspectj-maven-plugin</artifactId>
             <version>1.11</version>
             <configuration>
                 <source>1.8</source>
                 <target>1.8</target>
                 <complianceLevel>1.8</complianceLevel>
                 <aspectLibraries>
                     <aspectLibrary>
                         <groupId>software.amazon.lambda</groupId>
                         <artifactId>powertools-tracing</artifactId>
                     </aspectLibrary>
                     <aspectLibrary>
                         <groupId>software.amazon.lambda</groupId>
                         <artifactId>powertools-logging</artifactId>
                     </aspectLibrary>
                 </aspectLibraries>
             </configuration>
             <executions>
                 <execution>
                     <goals>
                         <goal>compile</goal>
                     </goals>
                 </execution>
             </executions>
        </plugin>
        ...
    </plugins>
</build>
```

## Tenets

* **AWS Lambda only** – We optimise for AWS Lambda function environments and supported runtimes only. Utilities might work with web frameworks and non-Lambda environments, though they are not officially supported.
* **Eases the adoption of best practices** – The main priority of the utilities is to facilitate best practices adoption, as defined in the AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens; all other functionality is optional.
* **Keep it lean** – Additional dependencies are carefully considered for security and ease of maintenance, and prevent negatively impacting startup time.
* **We strive for backwards compatibility** – New features and changes should keep backwards compatibility. If a breaking change cannot be avoided, the deprecation and migration process should be clearly defined.
* **We work backwards from the community** – We aim to strike a balance of what would work best for 80% of customers. Emerging practices are considered and discussed via Requests for Comment (RFCs)
* **Idiomatic** – Utilities follow programming language idioms and language-specific best practices.

_`*` Core utilities are Tracer, Logger and Metrics. Optional utilities may vary across languages._
